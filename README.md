[This tutorial guides you through how to use some built-in models in IBM Watson™ Visual Recognition to classify an image and then detect faces in an image.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/visual-recognition?topic=visual-recognition-getting-started-tutorial)

1) custom image classifier with Watson Visual Recognition; 

2) deploying the custom visual model on IBM Cloud and then use in your applications; 

3) integrating other Watson cognitive services in your applications.
