# Image recognition

Natural disasters can’t be prevented but we can be better prepared. In this workshop you will learn about solutions to help with natural disasters preparedness/recovery. You will learn about: 

1. custom image classifier with Watson Visual Recognition 
1. deploying the custom visual model on IBM Cloud and then use in your applications 
1. integrating other Watson cognitive services in your applications.
