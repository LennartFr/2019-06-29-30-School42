## Introduction

[Call for code challenge 2019](https://callforcode.org/challenge/)

Natural disasters can’t be prevented but we can be better prepared. In this workshop you will learn about solutions to help with natural disasters preparedness/recovery. You will learn about: 

1. custom image classifier with Watson Visual Recognition 

1. deploying the custom visual model on IBM Cloud and then use in your applications 

1. integrating other Watson cognitive services in your applications.

## Step by Step Introduction to Visual Recognition in the IBM Cloud

1. [Select "Watson Visual Recognition service" in the IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/visual-recognition). 
   Click on "Create" in bottom right corner to create an instance of the Watson Visual Recognition in the IBM Cloud
1. Click on the hamburger menu at the uppler left hand corner in the window and select 
[Resource List](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources)
1. Click on your "Visual Recognition Service" in the Services Section. This is the Visual Recognition Service you just created.
1. Click on "Manage" in the upper left hand corner
1. Click on the "Show Credentials" to the right in the picture below to make it visible and then click on the "copy API 
   key icon: for later use. To invoke the Visual Recognition service we will need the API key.

1. [Click "API Reference"](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/visual-recognition) for a description on how to invoke the Visual Recognition Service from Curl, Go, Java, Node, Python, Ruby, and Swift.

1. [Click on "Visual Recognition Service"](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/visual-recognition?code=try) for a number of  
    examples of how to invoke the Visual Recognition Service with Curl, Go, Java, Node, Python Ruby and Swift.
